     <p> I am a Venezuelan-American 4th year undergraduate, majoring in Biology and Environmental Studies at New York University. I have a love for all critters, although I am especially fond of the 'creepy crawlies' not only because they get no love from other humans, but also due to their value as indicators of ecosystem health. I am generally interested in the ways in which invertebrate community structure and function is altered by human activity, with a particular focus on how the novel stressors associated with the urban jungle contribute to the formation of novel ecosystems. However, I have worked with a wide array of other taxa, and I am driven first and foremost by the question, not favorites.

        Ultimately, the impact of science is limited by scientists capacity to communicate effectively. For this reason, I aspire to be a capable communicator of science, whether teaching students in a traditional classroom, or engaging the general public through less-formal means. Whether it be a written article or a video-essay, I hope to show audiences the spark of curiosity that drives me and other scientists to our work. In doing so, I am not only showing that scientists are human too, but that we can be something other than the norm; to be transgender in academia is an open act of defiance, and I defy so that future generations do not have to. </p>
