        <p> I am a Venezuelan-American 4th year undergraduate, majoring in Biology and Environmental Studies at New York University. I have a love for all critters, although I am especially fond of the 'creepy crawlies' not only because they get no love from other humans, but also due to their value as indicators of ecosystem health. I am generally interested in the ways in which invertebrate community structure and function is altered by human activity, with a particular focus on how the novel stressors associated with the urban jungle contribute to the formation of novel ecosystems. However, I have worked with a wide array of other taxa, and I am driven first and foremost by the question, not favorites.
           <br> <br>
           Ultimately, the impact of science is limited by scientists capacity to communicate effectively. For this reason, I aspire to be a capable communicator of science, whether teaching students in a traditional classroom, or engaging the general public through less-formal means. Whether it be a written article or a video-essay, I hope to show audiences the spark of curiosity that drives me and other scientists to our work. In doing so, I am not only showing that scientists are human too, but that we can be something other than the norm; to be transgender in academia is an open act of defiance, and I defy so that future generations do not have to. </p>

   <h3>Work Experience:</h3>
<div class="permaBox aboutMe">
    <p> I began my research career when I was selected to participate in an NSF-funded Research Experience For Undergraduates (REU), where I worked with <a href="https://www.matthew-sasaki.com/">Dr. Matthew Sasaki</a> on the thermal physiology of <i>Acartia tonsa</i>, an estuarine  copepod widespread throughout the world. I designed 2 experiments to test the effect of varying food composition and availability on thermal tolerance, finding that increasing starvation period resulted in decreased critical thermal maxima.  With the aid of Dr. Sasaki, we wrote up our results into a paper, which is now <a href="Contact.html" >published</a> in the journal of Ecology and Evolution 
        <br> <br>
        Eager to apply my skills, I joined <a href="https://kmwinchell.com/">Dr. Kristin Winchell’s </a> nascent urban evolutionary ecology lab. Here, I have worked on a wide array of different research projectsm generally focused on how organisms adapt to the stressors of the Urban Jungle. I began my work here studying the wing morphology of the invasive spotted lanternfly (<i>Lycorma delicatula</i>), working with a fellow undergraduate to understand their life history in the United States. This project made me think about how the wider urban invertebrate community responds to anthropogenic stressors. Moreover, I have collaborated with Dr. Valentina Alaasam on the "Luxury Effect” project, which seeks to examine how socioeconomic factors impact urban biodiversity across three group of taxa.</p>
